// Features layer entry point
// This file re-exports all features from the features layer

// Example Authentication feature (to be implemented)
// export * from './auth';

// Example Theme Switcher feature (to be implemented)
// export * from './theme-switcher';

// For now, this is a placeholder until actual features are implemented
export const FEATURES_PLACEHOLDER = "Features will be implemented here";
